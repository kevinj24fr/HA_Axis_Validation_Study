## Methods

### Statistical Model

**Design**: Paired comparison with blocking by animal ID

```r
# Design matrix
design <- model.matrix(~ 0 + group, data = metadata)
# where group = condition:timepoint interaction

# Contrasts: Implant - Control at each timepoint
contrasts <- makeContrasts(
  Week0 = Implant.Week0 - Control.Week0,
  Week1 = Implant.Week1 - Control.Week1,
  ...
)

# Account for paired design
corfit <- duplicateCorrelation(expr, design, block = metadata$animal_id)
fit <- lmFit(expr, design, block = metadata$animal_id, 
             correlation = corfit$consensus)
```

### Significance Criteria

| Criterion | Threshold |
|-----------|-----------|
| Adjusted p-value | < 0.05 (Benjamini-Hochberg FDR) |
| Log2 fold change | ≥ 1.0 (absolute value) |

### ECM Axis Enrichment

For each timepoint, enrichment of ECM axis genes in DEGs is calculated:
- **Overlap**: Number of axis genes that are DEGs
- **Fold enrichment**: Observed / Expected overlap
- **P-value**: Fisher's exact test

## Dependencies

```r
library(limma)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```
